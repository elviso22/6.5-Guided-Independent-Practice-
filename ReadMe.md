# 2.6 Guided/Independent Practice

Sherman's Shoe Store needs to add same style to their website. Let's follow the directions below to add some CSS!

## Code Along
1. The images on this page are too big. Let me use CSS to resize them. First, I am going to go to the CSS panel and choose a selector. Please write this on your code as I do. 
2. Next, let me put curly braces. I am going to write the code to change the size of the images between the opening and closing curly brace.
3. Third, I am going to put the property. This is what I want to change about the img tag. What property should I use to change the size of the images?
4. Finally, I need to choose a value. This is HOW I want to change my property. Because we're changing the size of the images, this should be in pixels (px).

## Code It Solo
5. Use what you learned about CSS to change the color of the `<h1>`. Remember, the property to change the color of text is `color` and the value is the name of the color you want ([or use a hex code!](https://www.google.com/search?q=hex+color+picker&oq=hex+color+pic&aqs=chrome.0.0i433i512j69i57j0i512l8.4405j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8))
6. Now change the background color of the ENTIRE page. Remember, the property for background color is  `background-color`. In this case, what should my selector be? (Hint: what HTML tag are all the tags between?)

Bonus: Can you center the `<h1>` which says "Sherman's Shoe Store"? The property to change the position of text is `text-align` and the value for centering should be `center`.
